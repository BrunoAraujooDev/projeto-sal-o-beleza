# Projeto 04 - Gest√£o

 A project that I did in order to simulate a search for sallon and barber shop in the Rio de Janeiro region.


## Getting started

 - Firstly, you need to instal all the depedencies using by npm install;
 - Secondly, you need to get the back-end in the project https://github.com/BrunoAraujooDev/bff-strapi-projeto-salao, and then use npm install in order to use the application;
 - Later on, use npm start in the back-end and then in the front-end to start to use the app;
 - Lastly, have fun!

## Technologies:

- ReactJS;
- Redux;
- Styled-components;
- Strapi.
